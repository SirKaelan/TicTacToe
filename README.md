## Description

A simple tic tac toe project that had a main focus on learning React Context (although it was a bit overkill for the size of this project) and an additional goal was to get a better feel for structuring the files/folders in a way that enabled, hopefully, a quick lookup and management of everything. Alongside all of that I was trying to understand how to think when deciding what should be its own component.

### `npm start`
